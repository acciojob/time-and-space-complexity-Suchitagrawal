		<h1>Time,Space,Complexity</h1>
		<p>The valid algorithm takes a finite amount of time for execution. The time required by the algorithm to solve given problem is called Time complexity  of the algorithm. Time complexity is very useful measure in algorithm analysis and it is very efficient also.</p>
